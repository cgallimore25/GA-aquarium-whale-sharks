### Description

The [\DATA](https://github.com/cgallimore25/GA-aquarium-whale-sharks/tree/main/DATA) folder contains the master datasheet common across all main figure scripts. Supplementary or otherwise targeted datasets can be found in the specific folders with the script that uses them. The [\functions](https://github.com/cgallimore25/GA-aquarium-whale-sharks/tree/main/functions) folder contains all separate functions used by the main figure scripts. The [LICENSES.txt](https://github.com/cgallimore25/GA-aquarium-whale-sharks/blob/main/functions/LICENSES.txt) file lists open-source code by others that were used in, but not custom-written for, this work.

### Requirements

All analyses were performed with `MATLAB` version `9.13` (R2022b) and utilize the following `toolboxes` and `version no.`:
1. `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox 12.4`
2. `Signal Processing Toolbox 9.1`
3. `Image Processing Toolbox 11.6`
4. `Curve Fitting Toolbox 3.8`
5. `Aerospace Toolbox 4.3`
